This is the general documentation for Ryan Vaz and Justin Lau's AP Computer Science Principles Create App
Control Flow-
1. This program starts compilation at main.cpp and initializes a game.
   After that, it starts looping the render, update and event handler.
2. When the Game is initialized, it heads into the Game.cpp file and makes
   the GameEngine object.
3. The initialization of the Game makes a window(window1), and a global renderer
   and it creates 2 SDL Textures with a tilemap
4. The SDL Texture is stored as a game engine with movement functions and storing
   the main texture, it generates this using the generateTexture function from texture.cpp
5. The tilemap is it's own class(Tilemap.cpp), which uses a 2d array to store integer values
   and each integer value cooresponds to a texture in memory.
6. Once the textures are initializes, the while loop begins running and the event handler,
   updater and renderer being running
7. g1->eventHandler() takes in input from the user and tries to map it onto the switch in Game.cpp
   Event Handler also has function GameEngine::EventHandler which maps UI to WASD
8. g1->update() calls all GameEngine objects to move the destinationRectangle in GameEngine.cpp
9. g1->render() updates all textures and maps it into the window1
10.g1->memManage() runs when the game loop ends, it cleans up all loose memory and closes SDL

Changelog:
27/3/20 - First push to github, the code is able to put a sprite on screen and is able to make it move
but the user has no control over the movement. A basic Entity Component system is added, we will work
on it tommorow, or try to find a way to make the character move.

30/3/20 - This code is now able to take in UserInput via WASD in the g1->update() function, we also
removed the Entity Component system in favor of a Model Vector which we will implement later on

31/3/20 - Tilemap loader has been implemented using a ifstream to read the TileMap stored in Maps folder

2/4/20 - Direction manager has been implemented and collision detector framework is in place



Goals:
	Finish the first Tileset and pixelarts
    Create DirectionHandler
	Create ActionHandler (expand on the direction handler)
	Create BattleHandler (Might create new window)
	Extra Goal: CutsceneHandler (likely using threads)
